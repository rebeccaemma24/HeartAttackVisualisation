# HeartAttackVisualisation
Practice of understanding a novel dataset looking at predicting heart attack, using R

## Data 
These data are publically available at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/juledz/heart-attack-prediction?resource=download)
Information from Kaggle on the data:
  "_This dataset, compiled in 1988, encompasses information from four distinct databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. Comprising 76 attributes, inclusive of the predicted attribute, the dataset has been predominantly utilized in published experiments focusing on a subset of 14 key features. The critical "target" field denotes the percentage of heart attack risk in patients."
  
## Objectives
1. Exploratory data analysis on a novel dataset
2. Visualisations of data
