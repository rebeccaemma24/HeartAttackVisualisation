# HeartAttackVisualisation
Practice of understanding a novel dataset looking at predicting heart attack, using R

## Data 
- These data are publically available at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/juledz/heart-attack-prediction?resource=download)
- Information from Kaggle on the data:
- *"This dataset, compiled in 1988, encompasses information from four distinct databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. Comprising 76 attributes, inclusive of the predicted attribute, the dataset has been predominantly utilized in published experiments focusing on a subset of 14 key features. The critical "target" field denotes the percentage of heart attack risk in patients."*
  
## Objectives
1. Exploratory data analysis on a novel dataset
2. Visualisations of data

## Navigation
- See heart_attack.md for clear markdown file of R code and results, alongside graphs/visualisations. Associated figures are located in heart_attack_files.
